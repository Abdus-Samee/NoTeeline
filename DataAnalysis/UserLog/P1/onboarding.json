It has an outer and inner membrane, and in the inbetween space called the intermembrance space ATP is generated with oxidative phosporelation(?)","keypoints":["atp, mitrochondria, energy, outer membrane, inner, matrix, intermembrane space, oxidative phos"],"transcript":"mitochondria. Here, food is converted into chemical energy called ATP. ATP is released by the mitochondria,  so cells can use it. Mitochondria consists of two membranes, an outer membrane separating it from  the cytosol, and an inner membrane surrounding the so called matrix. The area between these  membranes is called the inter membrane space. ATP is generated at the inner membrane of mitochondria  by an efficient mechanism called oxidative phosphorylation"},{"id":2,"note":"The video describes what psychologists are interested in wrt to motivation, which is defined as initiating and maintaining behavior. They believe knowing the source of motivation is the key to maintaining motivation.","keypoints":["motivation, psychologist, initiate, mantain behavior, source, maintain"],"transcript":"Why does motivation seem so fickle? And what even is it in the first place? Psychologists define motivation as the desire or impetus to initiate and maintain a particular behavior. In other words, it's the energy that drives you to do something. And knowing the source of that drive is particularly important when it comes to understanding how to maintain it."}]
