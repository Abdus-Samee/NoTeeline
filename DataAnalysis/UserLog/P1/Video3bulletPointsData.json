  "summary_t": "Chieko Asakawa, an IBM Fellow and distinguished service professor at Carnegie Mellon University, delivered a keynote speech at CHI 2021, discussing the evolution of technology for the visually impaired and her personal journey as a blind individual. She highlighted the significant advancements in accessibility, from the days when there were no personal computers or internet to the current era of smartphones and AI, which have drastically improved the quality of life for blind people.\n\nAsakawa introduced the AI Suitcase, a navigation robot project designed to assist the visually impaired in navigating complex environments. The suitcase uses sensors, machine learning, and mapping technologies to guide users, providing them with independence and the ability to explore their surroundings more freely.\n\nShe emphasized the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration, social acceptance, and the implementation of new technologies to improve accessibility. Asakawa also mentioned her new role as the chief executive director of the Japanese National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation, where she aims to create an accessible museum experience and promote the social implementation of new technologies.\n\nThe talk concluded with a Q&A session, where Asakawa addressed questions about the design challenges of the AI Suitcase, the importance of building trust with users, and the potential of technology to continue making positive impacts on the lives of individuals with disabilities.",
