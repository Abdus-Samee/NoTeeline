  "summary_t": "Memories are formed when experiences trigger electrical impulses in the brain, moving from short-term to long-term memory via the hippocampus and other areas. The strength and retention of memories depend on factors like attention, engagement, and personal relevance. Over time, memories can fade due to aging, which affects neuron communication and neurotransmitter production, including acetylcholine, crucial for learning and memory. Chronic stress and depression can also impair memory by reducing the ability to pay attention and form new memories, while social interaction appears to slow memory decline. To preserve memories, it's recommended to stay physically active, eat a nutritious diet, and mentally challenge the brain with activities like learning new languages.",
  "summary_p": "Memories are formed through electrical impulses triggered by experiences, initially stored in short-term memory before transitioning to long-term memory, a process involving neuron communication and long-term potentiation. As individuals age, the brain, particularly the hippocampus, shrinks, leading to a decrease in synapse numbers and neurotransmitter production, which impairs memory retention. Chronic stress and depression further exacerbate memory loss by hindering concentration and reducing the brain's ability to form new memories, with stress potentially causing brain cell loss and depression making concentration on new information difficult. To combat memory decline, engaging in social interactions, staying physically active, maintaining a nutritious diet, and challenging the brain with new learning experiences are recommended strategies.",
