  "summary_t": "Michael Wyetzner, an architect with over 35 years of experience in New York City, examines the design of four of the city's most visited art museums and how their architecture caters to their collections and visitors. \n\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art, founded in 1872, has expanded multiple times from its original Victorian Gothic style building designed by Calvert Vaux to include classical additions by Richard Morris Hunt and Beaux-Arts extensions by McKim, Mead & White. It now spans five city blocks along Fifth Avenue and houses a vast collection, with various gallery spaces designed to accommodate different types of art and visitor flow.\n\nThe Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), established in 1929, was originally housed in a Bauhaus-style building by Philip Goodwin and Edward Durrell Stone. It has undergone several expansions, creating a complex of different architectural styles on 53rd Street. The museum's galleries are designed as clean white boxes to showcase modern art, contrasting with the more ornate galleries of older museums.\n\nThe Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, is known for its unique spiral ramp gallery that offers a continuous viewing experience. However, its design has been critiqued for not being well-suited to displaying large modern artworks.\n\nThe Whitney Museum of American Art's original building, now known as the Met Breuer (and later becoming the Frick), was designed by Marcel Breuer in an inverted ziggurat form. It features a distinctive granite fa√ßade with few windows and a moat-like sculpture garden, emphasizing simplicity and materiality in line with Bauhaus principles. The building's interior galleries were designed to display large modern pieces with flexible, open spaces.\n\nWyetzner's analysis highlights how each museum's architectural design is closely tied to its collection, visitor experience, and the historical context of its expansion.",
  "summary_p": "The Metropolitan Museum of Art's design, deeply influenced by its Victorian Gothic origins, mirrors the fairy-tale essence of its Central Park setting, sharing the same architect, Calvert Vaux, enhancing its historical and aesthetic connection to the surrounding landscape. Over the years, the museum has expanded significantly, now stretching five blocks along Fifth Avenue, while ensuring the original facade remains visible, showcasing a thoughtful blend of growth and preservation. Richard Morris Hunt, known for the base of the Statue of Liberty, contributed to this expansion by adding a classical style to the museum's architecture, enriching its visual and historical narrative. These expansions, including a significant addition by McKim, Mead & White, have not only allowed for a broader display of its vast collection but also brought the museum closer to the street, making it more accessible and inviting to the public.",
