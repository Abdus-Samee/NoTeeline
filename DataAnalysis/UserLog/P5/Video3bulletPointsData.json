  "summary_t": "Aaron Cormet hosts a Webflow livestream where he discusses custom CSS properties and values with guest Corey Moen. They cover how to use the new feature in Webflow, which allows users to add custom CSS properties directly in the style panel, enhancing the capabilities of the platform. Corey shares his expertise on CSS, emphasizing the benefits of using custom properties for text wrapping and dynamic typography. The stream includes a live demonstration where they apply the `text-wrap` property with the `balance` value to a subtitle element and use a custom cursor for a 3D spline image. They also explore fluid typography using the `clamp` function to smoothly scale font sizes across different viewport widths. The session includes references to MDN Web Docs for learning about CSS properties and functions, and a spreadsheet is utilized to calculate appropriate values for the `clamp` function. The community's creative uses of custom properties are showcased, and the integration of variables from Figma into Webflow is highlighted as a powerful feature for streamlining design to code workflows. The stream concludes with a call to action for viewers to embrace learning and experimenting with these new features in their projects.",
  "summary_p": "Webflow's platform empowers users to employ HTML and CSS properties similar to those used by developers, facilitating the creation of websites from large-scale projects to local businesses. It offers native components that provide access to a comprehensive range of properties, enabling responsive design directly within the designer interface. The platform is built to ensure compatibility of individual classes and selectors with code, enhancing efficiency, learning, and safety from the start. Additionally, custom CSS properties in Webflow allow for native styling options, particularly effective in managing text to reflect the website's identity.",
