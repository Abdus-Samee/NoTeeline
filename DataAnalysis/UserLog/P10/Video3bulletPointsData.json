  "summary_t": "Clean water is essential for urban life, not only for drinking but also for sanitation and firefighting, requiring a reliable and constant water supply system. Operating such a system involves sourcing, purifying, and distributing water efficiently, with elevated storage tanks (water towers) playing a crucial role in managing demand fluctuations and maintaining pressure. Water towers help balance peak water demands, provide emergency reserves for firefighting, and store energy by using gravity to maintain system pressure, reducing the need for constant pump operation. This storage system also ensures public health by preventing contaminants from entering the distribution system during low-pressure situations. Some cities may use separate pressure zones or additional pumps in tall buildings to address varying elevation challenges. While water towers are not the only solution and can have drawbacks like cost and space requirements, they are a reliable component of public water infrastructure.
