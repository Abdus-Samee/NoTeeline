  "summary_t": "Memories form when experiences trigger electrical pulses in a network of neurons, moving from short-term to long-term memory via the hippocampus and other brain regions. The strength of a memory depends on factors like attention, engagement, and relevance. Memory loss can occur due to aging, which weakens synaptic connections and reduces neuron count and neurotransmitter production. Chronic stress and depression also impair memory by affecting brain cell health and attention levels. Social interaction appears to slow memory decline, suggesting it provides a cognitive workout. To preserve memories, it is recommended to stay physically active, eat a nutritious diet, and mentally challenge the brain with activities like learning new languages.",
  "summary_p": "Memory formation involves electrical pulses traveling through neurons during experiences, transitioning from short-term to long-term storage in the hippocampus, with synaptic efficiency improving through repetition. Aging affects memory by weakening synaptic connections, reducing neuron count, and decreasing neurotransmitter levels, while chronic stress and depression impair memory by disrupting brain cell health and diminishing attention. Social interaction has been found to slow the rate of memory decline, indicating its role in providing cognitive stimulation. To combat memory loss, engaging in physical exercise, maintaining a nutritious diet, and challenging the brain with activities like learning new languages are recommended strategies.",
