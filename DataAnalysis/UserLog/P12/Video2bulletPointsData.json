  "summary_t": "Memories are formed when experiences trigger electrical impulses in neurons, which first enter short-term memory and then are transferred to long-term memory through the hippocampus and other brain regions. The process of long-term potentiation, where repeated communication between neurons becomes more efficient, is key to storing memories. However, memories can fade due to aging, which can weaken synapses and lead to a decline in neuron count and neurotransmitter production. Memory retention is also affected by the ability to pay attention, which can be hindered by mental and physical health issues, chronic stress, and depression. Social interaction may help slow memory decline, as it provides mental stimulation. To preserve memories, it is recommended to stay physically active, maintain a healthy diet, and engage in mental challenges, such as learning new skills.",
  "summary_p": "Recalling vivid memories, such as a significant life event, is often easier than remembering mundane details like what was eaten for lunch three weeks ago, highlighting the variability in memory strength and vividness. This discrepancy raises questions about why some memories are more impactful than others, with the process involving short-term memories being converted into long-term ones through neuronal communication and long-term potentiation. Aging and factors like chronic stress and depression can weaken synapses and decrease neurotransmitter production, impairing memory retention and retrieval. Engaging in social interactions, staying physically active, and challenging the brain with new learning experiences are recommended strategies for preserving memory and cognitive function.",
