  "summary_t": "BC, a 29-year-old man, was admitted to the emergency room disoriented after consuming an excessive amount of probiotic gummies. Previously, he had dental issues that led to tooth extractions and antibiotic use, which disrupted his gut bacteria balance. To counter the negative effects of antibiotics, BC turned to gummy probiotics, believing they would restore his gut health. However, he overindulged, eating 120 gummies in one sitting, which led to serious health complications.\n\nMedical examination revealed he had a fever, leukocytosis, and an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly). Further investigations, including a CT scan and echocardiogram, showed that BC had developed infective endocarditis, a bacterial infection on his heart valve likely caused by the Lactobacillus paracasei found in the probiotic gummies. This infection led to a septic blood clot that blocked blood supply to his spleen.\n\nThe bacteria from the gummies had likely entered his bloodstream through his damaged gums and inflamed heart valves. BC's condition required surgery to repair his heart valves and a course of targeted antibiotics to clear the infection. After surgery and continued medical care, he made a full recovery. The case highlights the dangers of excessive consumption of probiotic supplements and the importance of moderation, even with seemingly benign products.",

        "A Man Ate 120 Gummy Probiotics For \nLunch. This Is How His Organs Shut Down.",
        "BC is a 29 year old man, presenting to the \nemergency room disoriented. He tries to tell  ",
        "the admitting nurse what happened. He thinks hes \ntalking, but words arent coming out of his mouth.",
        "BC recently had bad luck with his teeth. They \nfound multiple cavities. He got them filled,  ",
        "but some of the fillings fell out. It didnt \nhurt so he didnt know, until it was too late.",
        "BC eventually needed to get multiple teeth pulled,  ",
        "and he needed antibiotics afterwards. The \nmouth has a lot of bacteria and wounds and  ",
        "openings in the gums can leak those bacteria \ninto the bloodstream. But these antibiotics  ",
        "got him really sick. Water exited his body \nlike never before, and it wouldn’t stop.",
        "At the doctor’s office, they found out what was \nhappening. Huge amounts of bacteria live in our  ",
        "gut. We need them to be well. They help us with \nmetabolism, mental health, immunity, nutrition,  ",
        "digestion, and overall normal function. \nAntibiotics are supposed to kill bacteria,  ",
        "so when an antibiotic is taken, especially \nby mouth, some of this gut bacteria is going  ",
        "to get destroyed. Most of the time, the body can \nhandle this. Your other choice is not taking them  ",
        "and risk a life threatening infection. But when \nthings go wrong, the wrong bacteria takes over,  ",
        "crowding out all the other species. This \ndisturbs our metabolism, our mental health,  ",
        "our immunity, our digestion. Everything becomes \na problem. The doctor finds BC has this wrong  ",
        "bacteria growing in his gut. If his problem is \nbecause of bacteria, then, clearly the solution  ",
        "is something that destroys bacteria, meaning, \nit’s time for him to go back on antibiotics.",
        "But… antibiotics caused this. BC didn't believe \nit was gonna help. He started searching online  ",
        "for answers. And it was here where he discovered \ngummy probiotics. This would be very helpful to  ",
        "him because gummys are soft and they won't wreck \nhis mouth. Rather than kill bacteria, he found  ",
        "it reasonable that adding more bacteria to “crowd \nout” this bad bacteria would be a viable solution.",
        "At first, he’d eat just a couple \nof gummies. But the more he ate,  ",
        "the less loose stools he’d have. Sometimes he \nwould wake up and feel amazing because he had  ",
        "eaten 50 probiotic gummies the day before. These \nwere so delicious and so soft he started eating  ",
        "more than he should have, until he found himself \naccidentally finishing a bottle in one sitting.",
        "Sometimes, he’d chew the gummies, and they’d get \nstuck in the holes where his teeth used to be.  ",
        "One day, BC accidentally ate 120 probiotic \ngummies for lunch. He continued to eat them  ",
        "in the days that passed. But, he didn’t feel \nwell. At first, he could feel a sweet taste  ",
        "at the back of his tongue, emerge randomly \nthroughout the day. Sometimes he’d stand up  ",
        "and feel like his insides were getting dragged \ninto the ground. He’d be sweaty suddenly. And  ",
        "then his left side started cramping. He became \ndizzy and confused, and then he collapsed to the  ",
        "ground as he calls for 911 and he's brought \nto the emergency room where we are now.",
        "At examination, the medical team notes that BC \nhas a fever. He’s confused and he can't answer  ",
        "all of their questions. Maybe something’s wrong \nwith his brain. A blood test finds that BC has  ",
