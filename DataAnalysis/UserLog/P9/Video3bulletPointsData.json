  "summary_t": "The text discusses the history and evolution of emoticons and emojis, beginning with a possible early instance of a smiley face in a 1648 poem by Robert Herrick. It then moves on to the creation of the first computer emoticon by Scott Fahlman at Carnegie Mellon University in 1982, which was designed to convey tone and emotion in digital communication. \n\nThe text also explores the development of Japanese emoticons, or kaomoji, which were independently created and are more expressive and intricate than their Western counterparts. It highlights the role of two-channel, a Japanese text board, in popularizing various kaomoji, including the iconic cat character Mona.\n\nThe text then shifts to the origin of emojis in Japan in 1999, their incorporation into the Unicode standard, and their explosion in popularity worldwide following their inclusion on the iPhone in 2007. Emojis have since become a significant part of modern digital communication and culture. The text concludes by reflecting on the ongoing evolution of digital communication symbols and the potential for future innovations.",
  "summary_p": "The history of emoticons and emojis traces back to a smiley face in a 1648 poem, with a significant leap in 1982 when Scott Fahlman created the first computer emoticon at Carnegie Mellon University to add tone to digital messages. Japanese emoticons, or kaomoji, emerged independently, offering a more expressive range than Western versions, with two-channel playing a crucial role in popularizing these, including the cat character Mona. Emojis, originating in Japan in 1999, gained global prominence after being adopted into the Unicode standard and appearing on the iPhone in 2007, revolutionizing digital communication. The evolution of these digital symbols continues, reflecting the dynamic nature of online communication and hinting at future innovations.",
