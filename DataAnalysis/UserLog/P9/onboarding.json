Here, food is converted into chemical energy called ATP. ATP is released by the mitochondria,  so cells can use it. Mitochondria consists of two membranes, an outer membrane separating it from  the cytosol, and an inner membrane surrounding the so called matrix. The area between these  membranes is called the inter membrane space. ATP is generated at the inner membrane of mitochondria  by an efficient mechanism called oxidative phosphorylation"},{"id":2,"note":"motivation - defined as desire or impetus to initiate or maintain a particular behaviour\nenergy that drives you to do something - the source\nimportant in understanding how to maintain","keypoints":["motivation, desire, initiate, maintain, behaviour, source"],"transcript":"Why does motivation seem so fickle?
