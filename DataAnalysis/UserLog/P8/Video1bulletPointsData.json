  "summary_t": "During the Victorian era in England, one extreme weight loss method involved swallowing tapeworms, a dangerous practice. Today's fad diets, while not as extreme, often promise quick weight loss. To evaluate if any rapid diets are effective and healthy, a thought experiment with identical twins Sam and Felix is considered. Sam chooses a slow weight loss approach by moderately reducing calorie intake and increasing exercise, leading to a gradual fat loss while maintaining muscle mass. Felix opts for a fast diet with severe calorie restriction, triggering a starvation response and muscle loss, which is counterproductive for sustained weight loss. Although Felix may initially lose water weight, it will return once he resumes normal eating. Detox diets that focus on certain nutrients can be beneficial for specific deficiencies but are not sustainable or suitable for everyone. Extreme diets can be harmful and unsustainable, and societal pressures often influence dieting. A healthier approach involves gradual weight loss and finding a sustainable lifestyle for individual well-being.",
  "summary_p": "The Victorian era's extreme weight loss method of swallowing tapeworms highlights the dangers of drastic dieting, a practice still echoed in modern fad diets that promise quick results but often lead to health issues. In a comparison between two identical twins, one adopting a slow, steady weight loss approach through moderate calorie reduction and increased exercise, and the other opting for rapid weight loss through severe calorie restriction, the former maintains muscle mass and achieves sustainable fat loss, while the latter experiences muscle loss and temporary water weight loss, which is quickly regained. Fast diets, including those that focus on detoxification or severe nutrient restriction, can compromise the immune system and are not sustainable long-term, often depending on an individual's specific nutritional needs and genetic makeup. Societal pressures continue to drive the popularity of rapid weight loss methods, despite their potential health risks and the proven benefits of a slower, more sustainable approach to weight management.",

        "bizarre fads ran rampant.",
        "But perhaps none was as strange\nas the tapeworm diet,",
        "in which dieters swallowed\nan unhatched tapeworm",
        "and let it grow inside them \nby consuming undigested meals.",
        "Obviously, this is an exceptionally\ndangerous and unhealthy way",
        "to manage your weight.",
        "However, while modern fad diets\naren't usually this extreme,",
        "they do promise similar results;\nspecifically, losing weight fast.",
        "So, are there any fast diets that do work?",
        "And are any of them \nactually healthy for you?",
        "To answer these questions, \nlet’s consider a thought experiment.",
        "Sam and Felix are identical twins\nboth planning to go on a diet.",
        "They share the same height, weight,\nfat and muscle mass.",
        "But Sam is hoping to lose weight slowly,\nwhile Felix wants to go fast.",
        "Sam's plan is to gradually decrease\nhis calorie intake",
        "and increase his regular exercise.",
        "With less energy coming in\nand more being expended,",
        "he’s creating an energy deficit\ninside his body.",
        "To compensate, Sam’s body begins breaking \ndown his emergency glucose supply,",
        "stored in the liver \nin the form of glycogen.",
        "Then, after 4 to 6 hours, \nhis body starts burning fat cells",
        "as a major energy source.",
        "This process releases lipid droplets",
        "which are broken down into compounds\nthat float through the bloodstream",
        "and provide energy to organs and tissues.",
        "Felix aims to create \na similar energy deficit",
        "by dramatically cutting \nhis calorie intake.",
        "Unlike Sam, \nwho’s still eating smaller meals,",
        "Felix is eating almost nothing.",
        "And his body responds by going\ninto a starvation response.",
        "Felix’s body breaks down his entire store\nof emergency glucose in just 18 hours.",
        "And while Sam steadily replenishes\nglycogen with every healthy meal,",
        "Felix’s low-calorie diet does not.",
        "Desperate for energy, his body starts\nbreaking down other materials,",
        "including his muscles.",
        "Meanwhile, Sam’s regular exercise \nis maintaining his muscle mass.",
        "This means he’ll use more energy\nboth during exercise and at rest,",
        "making it easier for him to lose weight.",
        "Felix, on the other hand,\nis losing muscle mass",
        "and burning fewer calories than ever\nfor his body's basic functions,",
        "making weight loss even more difficult.",
        "Despite all this, there’s one element\nof Felix’s fast diet",
        "that might make him think\nhe's on the right track.",
        "Every gram of glycogen is bound\nto several grams of water.",
        "This can add up to two kilograms\nof water weight,",
        "all of which is lost \nwhen the glycogen is depleted.",
        "For Felix, this might seem like\nhe’s losing weight fast.",
        "But as soon as he stops starving himself,",
        "his body will replenish its glycogen store\nand regain that weight.",
        "Clearly, Felix’s plan does\nmore harm than good,",
        "but extreme calorie reduction diets\naren’t the only regimens",
        "promising to shed weight fast.",
        "Plans called “detoxification diets” \neither promote or restrict certain foods",
        "to provide specific nutrients\nin high quantities.",
        "These can be useful for addressing\nsome nutritional problems,",
        "but they’re far too specific \nto be used as general cure-alls.",
        "For example, for a person \nwith low vitamin A,",
        "a juice diet might be helpful.",
        "But for someone high in vitamin A,\njuicing could be disastrous.",
        "And regardless of personal nutrition,",
        "maintaining a juice diet \nover multiple weeks",
        "is likely to compromise the immune system",
        "due to a lack of essential fats\nand proteins.",
        "Therein lies the problem \nwith all these fast-moving diets—",
        "whether you’re cutting calories\nor food groups,",
        "extreme diets are a shock to your system.",
        "There are well-established rates \nof healthy weight loss",
        "motivated by both diet and exercise",
        "that account for genetic and medical\ndifferences.",
        "And staying on those timelines requires \na dietary lifestyle that’s sustainable.",
        "In fact, some of the worst side effects\nof extreme diets",
        "are rarely discussed since so few people\nstick with them,",
        "it also bears mentioning that many\nsocieties have unhealthy relationships",
        "with weight,",
        "and people are often pressured to diet for\nreasons other than health or happiness.",
        "So rather than trying to lose weight fast,",
