  "summary_t": "Moneycontrol launched a new show called \"Pitchcraft\" in collaboration with Seed to Scale, where they deconstruct the pitch decks of successful Indian startups. The inaugural episode featured Girish Mathrubootham, the founder and CEO of Freshworks. Freshworks, initially called Freshdesk, was founded in 2010 by former Zoho executives Girish Mathrubootham and Shan Krishnasamy as a customer support software company. It raised $1 million from Accel in 2011 and rebranded to Freshworks, eventually becoming the first Indian SaaS firm to list on NASDAQ in 2021.\n\nThe show delved into Freshworks' original pitch deck from when the company was raising its Series A round. Girish shared that his initial goal was modest â€“ to earn a decent salary by building a product he was familiar with. However, realizing the need for venture capital to cover upfront marketing costs in a SaaS model, he researched how to create a pitch deck. His deck focused on the team's expertise, the problem they were solving, the business model, and early traction with paying customers from around the world.\n\nShaker Kirani from Accel, who wrote the first check for Freshworks, discussed what stood out to him in the pitch deck, including the team's attention to detail, understanding of the market, and Girish's storytelling ability. Girish, now on the investor side with his fund, emphasized the importance of a well-crafted deck and the ability to educate investors about the business and market opportunity. The full pitch deck is available on Moneycontrol's website.",
  "summary_p": "Before founding Freshworks in 2010, Girish Mathrubootham was unfamiliar with the venture capital world and initially aimed to bootstrap his business to ensure decent salaries for his team. However, he soon realized the significance of upfront investment in customer acquisition for the long-term profitability of a SaaS model, leading him to educate himself on creating a pitch deck, notably through resources like Venture Hacks by Naval Ravikant. The importance of a well-crafted pitch deck became evident, serving not only as a crucial first impression for investors but also as a vital tool in securing meetings with the right people. Conversely, a poorly constructed deck could significantly hinder a startup's chances of securing funding, underscoring the deck's role in the fundraising process.",
