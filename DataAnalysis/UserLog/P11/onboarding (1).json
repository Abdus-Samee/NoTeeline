Here, food is converted into chemical energy called ATP. ATP is released by the mitochondria,  so cells can use it. Mitochondria consists of two membranes, an outer membrane separating it from  the cytosol, and an inner membrane surrounding the so called matrix. The area between these  membranes is called the inter membrane space. ATP is generated at the inner membrane of mitochondria  by an efficient mechanism called oxidative phosphorylation"},{"id":2,"note":"Motivation - How does it comes in and how to maintain it?\n\nSource of the motivation is important as it's the energy that drives us to do something.

And knowing the source of that drive is particularly important when it comes to understanding how to maintain it."}]
