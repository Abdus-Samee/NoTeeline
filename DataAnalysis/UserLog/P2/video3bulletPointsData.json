  "summary_t": "The speaker is continuing a lecture on Java programming, focusing on object-oriented concepts such as object creation, variable declaration, and method calling. They explain how to declare a variable (e.g., a String variable s1), assign a new object to it, and use comments in Java. The lecture also covers combining variable declaration and assignment into one step, the concept of references, and the difference between two variables pointing to the same object versus two separate objects with identical data.\n\nThe speaker demonstrates how to copy an object using a constructor and highlights the importance of understanding object references in Java. They discuss string objects, which are immutable in Java, meaning their contents cannot be changed once created. Methods to manipulate strings are introduced, such as `toUpperCase`, `concat`, and the shorthand for concatenation using the `+` operator.\n\nThe lecture then transitions to input and output in Java, focusing on the `System.out` and `System.in` objects for writing to the screen and reading from the keyboard, respectively. To read lines from the keyboard, the speaker explains the need to create a `BufferedReader` object using an `InputStreamReader`, which in turn uses the `System.in` input stream.\n\nFinally, the speaker presents a complete Java program example that reads a line of text from the keyboard and prints it to the screen. They also mention a modification to the program for reading from a webpage instead of the keyboard, using a `URL` object and its `openStream` method. The lecture concludes with a reminder about the first homework assignment related to these topics.",

        "objects and how to construct objects and",
        "how to use variables to reference",
        "objects and how to call methods on",
        "objects so you recall that if you want",
        "to use a variable you need to declare it",
        "so let's declare a variable called s1",
        "that's a string once you've declared a",
        "variable then you can assign things to",
        "it for instance we can set s1 to point",

        "it's also possible to combine both of",

        "can declare a new variable and assign it",
        "something at the same time so that's a",
        "nice little bit of syntactic sugar in",
        "Java so maybe you recall from last",
        "lecture but what these lines do is the",
        "first line declares a box which is a",
        "variable named s1 that can store",
        "references to strings and the second",
        "line constructs a brand new string",
        "object and the equal sign s1 equals new",
        "string creates a reference that's stored",
        "in the box s1 and that points to that",
        "new string object you've created and",
        "this final line here does the same thing",
        "with another variable called s2 and also",
        "creates another new string object which",
        "is different from the first string",
        "object let's look at some other things",
        "we can do one thing you can do is you",
        "can write s1 equals and then you can",
        "actually write a string between quotes",
        "and one of the things that's interesting",
        "about this line is that this also has a",
        "constructor in it",
        "this when you write in a Java program",
        "open quote Yahoo close quote that",
        "actually creates a string object right",
        "there on the spot when you execute that",
        "line of code and you get a string object",
        "with these characters in it by the way",
        "what is a string it's a sequence of",

        "characters in it so you can think of",
        "this maybe as being the same thing you'd",
        "get if you typed open quote close quote",
        "with nothing in between so now we've",
        "created this new object and once it's",
        "created the equal sign takes a reference",
        "to that object and stores it in the s-1",
        "box which overwrites the old value in",
        "the s-1 box",
        "so now s1 points to the new object and",
