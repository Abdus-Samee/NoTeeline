  "summary_t": "Memories form when experiences are converted into electrical energy and processed by neurons. Short-term memories last seconds to minutes before transferring to long-term memory via the hippocampus and other brain regions. Long-term potentiation enhances communication between neurons, aiding memory storage. Memory loss can occur due to aging, which affects synapses and neurotransmitter production, especially acetylcholine. Attention, engagement, and meaningfulness strengthen memory encoding, but stress, depression, and isolation can impair it. Chronic stress leads to a loss of brain cells, while depression, linked to low serotonin levels, diminishes attentiveness. Social interaction, however, can slow memory decline. To preserve memories, it's recommended to stay physically active, eat a balanced diet, and mentally challenge the brain, like learning a new language.",
  "summary_p": "Memories transition from short-term to long-term storage through a process that increases the efficiency of neuron communication, a mechanism crucial for vivid recollections. However, as we age, our brains can shrink and memory fades, influenced by factors like chronic stress and depression, which impair memory by reducing brain cell numbers and attentiveness, respectively. On the other hand, social interaction has been shown to mitigate memory decline. To combat memory loss, adopting a healthy lifestyle that includes physical activity, a balanced diet, and mental challenges, such as learning a new skill, is recommended.",
