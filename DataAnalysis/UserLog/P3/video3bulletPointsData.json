  "summary_t": "In the mid-18th century, England was fond of ketchup, which at the time was a brown sauce made without tomatoes and was used in various dishes, including desserts. This early version of ketchup evolved from fish sauce, a condiment dating back to ancient China and popularized by the Greeks and Romans as garum. After the fall of the Roman Empire, fish sauce use declined in Europe until reintroduced through trade with Southeast Asia by the Dutch East India Company. The term \"ketchup\" emerged in England as a catch-all for various brown sauces, leading to the creation of condiments like Worcestershire and HP sauce. \n\nThe tomato-based ketchup we know today originated with James Mease in 1812, who created a version using tomato pulp, spices, shallots, and brandy. The late 19th century saw the commercialization of tomato ketchup, with brands like Heinz emerging. Henry J. Heinz replaced preservatives with vinegar and ripe tomatoes, creating the thick sauce that became a staple in American households. Over the 20th century, ketchup's popularity spread worldwide, and Heinz's recipe became the foundation for many other sauces and dressings.",
  "summary_p": "In the mid-18th century, England's culinary scene embraced ketchup not as the tomato-based condiment we know today, but as a versatile, brown sauce derived from the ancient tradition of fermenting fish, a practice dating back to 300 BCE in China and later adopted by Greeks and Romans to create garum, a savory umami-rich seasoning. The decline of the Roman Empire saw the fall of garum's popularity in Europe until the Dutch East India Company reintroduced a similar fish sauce, leading to the development of various \"ketchup\" recipes in British cookbooks, including those without tomatoes but with ingredients like oysters, eventually paving the way for condiments like Worcestershire and HP sauce. The transformation of ketchup began with James Mease in 1812, who introduced tomatoes to the mix, utilizing their natural glutamate for umami flavor, a significant shift from the fish-based origins. This evolution culminated in the late 19th century with Henry J. Heinz perfecting a tomato ketchup recipe that replaced traditional preservatives with vinegar, setting the standard for the thick, rich sauce that gained global popularity, influencing countless other sauces and dressings.",
