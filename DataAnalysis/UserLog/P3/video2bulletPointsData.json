  "summary_t": "Memories are formed when experiences are converted into electrical energy and transmitted through neurons. Short-term memories last seconds to minutes before transferring to long-term memory via the hippocampus and other brain regions. Long-term potentiation, where repeated neuron communication enhances efficiency, is key to storing memories. Memory deterioration can occur due to aging, with factors like brain shrinkage, neurotransmitter decline, and reduced attention capacity playing roles. Chronic stress and depression also impair memory by affecting brain cell health and attentiveness. Social interaction appears to slow memory decline, suggesting mental engagement is beneficial. To preserve memory, staying physically active, eating well, and mentally challenging oneself are recommended strategies.",
  "summary_p": "Memories, from vivid experiences to daily lunches, fade over time due to the natural process of memory transfer from short-term to long-term storage, with the hippocampus playing a crucial role in this conversion. As individuals age, their ability to form and retain memories declines, influenced by factors such as brain shrinkage, neurotransmitter depletion, and diminished attention capacity, further exacerbated by chronic stress and depression which impair brain cell health and focus. Social interaction and mental engagement have been shown to slow the rate of memory decline, highlighting the importance of staying connected and mentally active. To combat memory deterioration, adopting a lifestyle that includes regular physical activity, a nutritious diet, and mental challenges, like learning new languages, is recommended.",
