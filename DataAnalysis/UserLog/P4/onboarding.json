Here, food is converted into chemical energy called ATP. ATP is released by the mitochondria,  so cells can use it. Mitochondria consists of two membranes, an outer membrane separating it from  the cytosol, and an inner membrane surrounding the so called matrix. The area between these  membranes is called the inter membrane space. ATP is generated at the inner membrane of mitochondria  by an efficient mechanism called oxidative phosphorylation"},{"id":2,"note":"- motivation is fickle and hard to maintain sometimes\n- motivation: desire or impotus to maintain behavior--the energy that drives you to do something","keypoints":["- motivation is fickle","- desire or impotus to maintain behavior","- energy that drives you to do smth","- understand the source"],"transcript":"Why does motivation seem so fickle?
