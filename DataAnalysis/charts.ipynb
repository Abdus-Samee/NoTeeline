answer these questions, \\nlet’s consider a thought experiment.', 'Sam and Felix are identical twins\\nboth planning to go on a diet.', 'They share the same height, weight,\\nfat and muscle mass.', 'But Sam is hoping to lose weight slowly,\\nwhile Felix wants to go fast.', \"Sam's plan is to gradually decrease\\nhis calorie intake\", 'and increase his regular exercise.', 'With less energy coming in\\nand more being expended,', 'he’s creating an energy deficit\\ninside his body.', 'To compensate, Sam’s body begins breaking \\ndown his emergency glucose supply,', 'stored in the liver \\nin the form of glycogen.', 'Then, after 4 to 6 hours, \\nhis body starts burning fat cells', 'as a major energy source.', 'This process releases lipid droplets', 'which are broken down into compounds\\nthat float through the bloodstream', 'and provide energy to organs and tissues.', 'Felix aims to create \\na similar energy deficit', 'by dramatically cutting \\nhis calorie intake.', 'Unlike Sam, \\nwho’s still eating smaller meals,', 'Felix is eating almost nothing.', 'And his body responds by going\\ninto a starvation response.', 'Felix’s body breaks down his entire store\\nof emergency glucose in just 18 hours.', 'And while Sam steadily replenishes\\nglycogen with every healthy meal,', 'Felix’s low-calorie diet does not.', 'Desperate for energy, his body starts\\nbreaking down other materials,', 'including his muscles.', 'Meanwhile, Sam’s regular exercise \\nis maintaining his muscle mass.', 'This means he’ll use more energy\\nboth during exercise and at rest,', 'making it easier for him to lose weight.', 'Felix, on the other hand,\\nis losing muscle mass', \"and burning fewer calories than ever\\nfor his body's basic functions,\", 'making weight loss even more difficult.', 'Despite all this, there’s one element\\nof Felix’s fast diet', \"that might make him think\\nhe's on the right track.\", 'Every gram of glycogen is bound\\nto several grams of water.', 'This can add up to two kilograms\\nof water weight,', 'all of which is lost \\nwhen the glycogen is depleted.', 'For Felix, this might seem like\\nhe’s losing weight fast.', 'But as soon as he stops starving himself,', 'his body will replenish its glycogen store\\nand regain that weight.', 'Clearly, Felix’s plan does\\nmore harm than good,', 'but extreme calorie reduction diets\\naren’t the only regimens', 'promising to shed weight fast.', 'Plans called “detoxification diets” \\neither promote or restrict certain foods', 'to provide specific nutrients\\nin high quantities.', 'These can be useful for addressing\\nsome nutritional problems,', 'but they’re far too specific \\nto be used as general cure-alls.', 'For example, for a person \\nwith low vitamin A,', 'a juice diet might be helpful.', 'But for someone high in vitamin A,\\njuicing could be disastrous.', 'And regardless of personal nutrition,', 'maintaining a juice diet \\nover multiple weeks', 'is likely to compromise the immune system', 'due to a lack of essential fats\\nand proteins.', 'Therein lies the problem \\nwith all these fast-moving diets—', 'whether you’re cutting calories\\nor food groups,', 'extreme diets are a shock to your system.', 'There are well-established rates \\nof healthy weight loss', 'motivated by both diet and exercise', 'that account for genetic and medical\\ndifferences.', 'And staying

       "\"Fad diets, like the tapeworm diet in Victorian England, may offer quick weight loss results but are generally unsafe and unhealthy for the body.Sam plans to gradually decrease his calorie intake and increase regular exercise to create an energy deficit for weight loss.Felix, who is fasting almost completely, triggers a starvation response in his body, leading to a rapid breakdown of his emergency glucose supply within 18 hours.Regular exercise helps in maintaining muscle mass, using more energy during physical activity and at rest, which ultimately supports weight loss.Slow dieting reduces fat mass by gradually decreasing calorie intake and increasing exercise, while fast dieting leads to muscle mass loss due to a dramatic cut in calorie intake without replenishing glycogen stores.Extreme calorie reduction diets, like Felix's, can lead to muscle loss, a decrease in calorie burning, and temporary water weight loss that quickly returns once normal eating resumes.A juice diet can be helpful for someone with low vitamin A but could be disastrous for someone high in vitamin A due to the varying effects of the same food on different individuals.Extreme diets, such as the tapeworm diet or extreme calorie reduction plans like Felix's, can shock the body and lead to negative effects like muscle loss and compromised immune system.\""
